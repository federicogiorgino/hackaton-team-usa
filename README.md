# Hackathon Ironhack February 2020 - Team U.S.A.

## Description
Your team has been hired by the Olympic Committee of your country to promote your national sports teams for the 2020 Olympics Games. Since the Olympics are just around the corner, your country wants your team to highlight the best sport, players, etc... and to promote your national sports teams, showing how they have evolved over time in terms of participation, sports, gender, etc. supported by visual storytelling in a well-designed app.

## Main deliverables:
- Data: Main insights from the dataset, Json format dataset, data analysis, data visualization, Statistical analysis (Inference) and Presentation (Storytelling).
- UX: high-fi interactive prototype in Sketch, with the user flow and interactions (extended version of the web app)
- Web Development: MVP in production running on Node, with minimum 3 pages (for ex. homepage, results page and details page)

### First iteration:
UX/UI:
- Benchmarking and Desk Research 
- How Might We
- First Sketches (crazy 8s)
- Moodboard

Data:
- Understand the dataset.
- Provide features names to UX/UI. (As early as possible)
- Group and filter the dataset based on the requirements of the project for your group.
- Follow standard data cleaning steps. (Info, describe, Check for NaN, Check for outliers, .......)
- Provide useful insights from the data to UX/UI so they can use it for the design of the website.

Web Development:
- Create Github repo and set collaborators 
- Write the README.md	
- Setup an Express.js server with Node.js (with Express-generator)	
- Deploy Node server on Heroku
- Deploy JSON Server on Heroku (empty, as you haven’t received the Json from Data yet)
- Add the link of the repo (with readme) + link of the deploy to this spreadsheet 

### Second iteration:
UX/UI:
- Style Tiles 
- Paper Prototype
- Deliver the items above to WD 

Data:
- Exploratory analysis for the features.

WD: 
- To use images, check out and test wikipedia API endpoints with Postman
- Receive style tiles and barebones from UX 
- Start with back-end routes 
- Create views with Handlebars template engine

### Third iteration:
Data:
- Slice the filtered dataset based on the structure provided by WebDev team as soon as they provide it.
- Prepare and export the data in Json format for WebDev team.

Web Development:
- Upload JSON file handed by Data team to the JSON server
- Database connection tested with Postman
- Keep working on the back-end routes and start rendering info in the views

### Fourth iteration:

UX/UI:
- Test Results and Iterations

Data:
- Data Visualization using Tableau.
- Collaborate with UX/UI for the design, theme and colors of the plots.
- Bonus: Upload visuals to Tableau server and share the Javascript “Embed Code” with WebDev so that they can implement the plots in the website (If they are interested).

Web Development:
- Finish rendering the views
- Start applying styles to views 
- Second deploy of the app (even if styles are not finished)


### Fifth iteration:

UX/UI:
- Slide deck (collaborate with data to prepare)
- Interactive prototype walkthrough of the final result (use Sketch, Marvel or Invision)
